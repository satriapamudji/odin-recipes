        Steps
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425˚F and line a roasting pan with foil.</li>
            <li>Prepare squash for puree - place squash halves on a baking sheet and divide butter, herbs, and garlic amongst each half. Season generously with salt and pepper and olive oil, roast until tender for about 45 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>Once squash is cool enough to handle, scoop out flesh (including garlic) and place in a blender along with roasted garlic, discarding herbs. Pulse until smooth, season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Prepare vinaigrette - in a small bowl, whisk together quince paste and 1 tablespoon hot water until smooth. Whisk in shallot, apple cider vinegar, and olive oil until smooth. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare slaw - toss together cabbages, pomegranate seeds, hazelnuts, and mint. Zest lemon over the slaw and toss with enough vinaigrette to coat, being careful to not over dress.</li>
            <li>Prepare scallops - Heat a skillet over high heat. Find the wide “top” side of the scallops and place facing up on a plate lined with a paper towel. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle hot pan with oil and sear scallops until golden and caramelized. Flip scallops and juice half a lemon over scallops, swirl in a few knobs of butter and let brown, finish with remaining lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>To serve - divide warmed squash puree amongst plates (or shallow bowls) and nestle scallops on top, garnishing with pomegranate-quince slaw and a drizzle of quince vinaigrette, serve immediately.</li>
